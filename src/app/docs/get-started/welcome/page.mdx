# Welcome to Frain

Frain is an open-source platform for visualizing software architecture as C4 model diagrams. Define your infrastructure as code and see it rendered as interactive diagrams.

---

## Why Frain?

<div className="grid gap-4 sm:grid-cols-3 mt-4">
    {
        features.map((feature) => (
            <FeatureCard key={feature.title} {...feature} />
        ))
    }
</div>

## Key Concepts

### Organizations

Group your projects under organizations. Control access with public or private visibility settings.

### Projects

Each project contains a C4 model definition. Projects can be public or private within an organization.

### C4 Model Views

Generate multiple diagram types from a single model: System Context, Container, Component, and Deployment views.
