# Quick Usage

Get up and running with Frain in minutes. This guide walks you through the essentials.

---

## 1. Create an Organization

After signing up, create an organization to group your projects. Organizations can be public (visible to everyone) or private (visible only to members).

Navigate to the dashboard and click **New Organization**. Give it a name and choose a visibility setting.

## 2. Create a Project

Inside your organization, create a project. Each project holds a single C4 model that describes your software architecture.

## 3. Define Your Architecture

Use the Frain DSL or the TypeScript SDK to define your system. Here's a simple example:

```typescript title="model.ts"
import { Frain } from "@anthropic/frain-sdk";

const workspace = Frain.workspace("My System");

// Define people and systems
const user = workspace.person("User", "A user of the system");
const webApp = workspace.softwareSystem("Web Application", "Serves the UI");
const api = workspace.softwareSystem("API", "Backend services");
const database = workspace.softwareSystem("Database", "Stores data");

// Define relationships
user.uses(webApp, "Browses");
webApp.uses(api, "Makes API calls to");
api.uses(database, "Reads from and writes to");
```

## 4. View Diagrams

Once your model is defined, Frain automatically generates interactive diagrams. You can view System Context, Container, Component, and Deployment diagrams directly in the browser.

Diagrams are rendered using an interactive canvas that supports zoom, pan, and element selection. Click on any element to see its details and relationships.

## Next Steps

- Explore the [TypeScript SDK](/docs/sdks/typescript) for programmatic access
- Invite team members to your organization for collaboration
- Use the visual editor or code-based approach to model complex systems
